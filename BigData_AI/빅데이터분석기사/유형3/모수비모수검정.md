Parametric and non-parametric tests are two broad categories of statistical tests used for hypothesis testing. The choice between them depends on the nature of the data and the assumptions one can reasonably make about the underlying population from which the data is drawn.

### Parametric Tests

**Definition**:
Parametric tests are statistical tests that make assumptions about the parameters (e.g., mean, variance) of the population distribution from which the sample is drawn. Typically, they assume that the data follows a certain distribution, most commonly a normal distribution.

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Assumptions**: Parametric tests generally assume:
  - Normal distribution of the data.
  - Homogeneity of variances (equal variances across groups).
  - Interval or ratio scale of measurement.
- **Examples**:
  - **t-tests** (one-sample t-test, independent samples t-test, paired samples t-test): Compare means between groups or conditions.
  - **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)**: Compare means across three or more groups.
  - **Linear Regression**: Examine relationships between variables.
  - **Pearson’s Correlation**: Measure the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two continuous variables.

**Advantages**:
- **Powerful**: Often more powerful than non-parametric tests when their assumptions are met, meaning they are more likely to detect a true effect.
- **Informative**: Provide more detailed information about the effect size and the relationship between variables.

**Disadvantages**:
- **Assumptions**: Must meet strict assumptions regarding the data distribution and other parameters. If these assumptions are violated, the results may be invalid.

### Non-Parametric Tests

**Definition**:
Non-parametric tests, also known as distribution-free tests, do not assume that the data follows a specific distribution. They are often used when the data does not meet the assumptions required for parametric tests.

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Assumptions**: Fewer and less stringent assumptions compared to parametric tests.
- **Examples**:
  - **Mann-Whitney U Test**: Compares differences between two independent groups (alternative to the independent samples t-test).
  - **Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test**: Compares differences between two related groups (alternative to the paired samples t-test).
  - **Kruskal-Wallis Test**: Compares differences across three or more independent groups (alternative to one-way ANOVA).
  - **Friedman Test**: Compares differences across three or more related groups (alternative to repeated measures ANOVA).
  - **Spearman’s Rank Correlation**: Measures the strength and direction of the relationship between two ranked variables.

**Advantages**:
- **Flexibility**: Can be used with ordinal data or non-normally distributed interval data.
- **Robust**: Less affected by outliers and non-normal distributions.

**Disadvantages**:
- **Less Powerful**: Generally less powerful than parametric tests when the assumptions for parametric tests are met.
- **Less Informative**: Provide less detailed information about the effect size and the relationship between variables.

### Choosing Between Parametric and Non-Parametric Tests

- **Data Distribution**: If the data is normally distributed and meets other assumptions, parametric tests are preferred due to their higher power. If the data is not normally distributed or the sample size is small, non-parametric tests are safer.
- **Scale of Measurement**: Parametric tests require interval or ratio scale data, whereas non-parametric tests can handle ordinal data.
- **Sample Size**: With small sample sizes, it’s often safer to use non-parametric tests unless the data clearly meets parametric assumptions.

### Examples of Parametric vs. Non-Parametric Tests

| Objective                            | Parametric Test                     | Non-Parametric Test                   |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Compare two independent groups       | Independent samples t-test           | Mann-Whitney U test                   |
| Compare two related groups           | Paired samples t-test                | Wilcoxon signed-rank test             |
| Compare three or more independent groups | One-way ANOVA                       | Kruskal-Wallis test                   |
| Compare three or more related groups | Repeated measures ANOVA              | Friedman test                         |
| Measure correlation                  | Pearson’s correlation                | Spearman’s rank correlation           |

### Conclusion

Both parametric and non-parametric tests have their place in statistical analysis. The choice depends on the nature of your data, the scale of measurement, the distribution, and the sample size. Understanding the assumptions and characteristics of each type of test is crucial for selecting the appropriate method and obtaining valid and reliable results.
